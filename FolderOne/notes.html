<!--
1. what is internet:
    -> abbreviation: inter-network communication
    -> internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols.(e.g., TCP/IP)
        -> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable data delivery and 
        -> IP (Internet Protocol) for addressing/routing packets. 

2. how does html page works?
    -> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages.
    -> From the browser page(client-side), a request is sent to server page(server side) via internet using standardized protocols(tcp/ip) and 
    the server side respond back to client side(browser) to display via internet. 
    
 3. Explain client-server architecture?   
    -> Client-Server Architecture:
        -> Client: The client is typically a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) that requests web pages and resources from a server.
        -> Server: The server is a computer that hosts websites and serves web pages to clients upon request.
        -> Communication: The client and server communicate over the internet using the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocols.   
        
4. diff between ip and dns?
    -> IP (Internet Protocol) Address:  
        IP address is the actual numerical "phone number" of a server (e.g., 142.250.190.46), 
    -> DNS (Domain Name System):
        DNS is the "phonebook" that translates human-friendly names (like google.com) into those numbers.        

    -> When you type a URL into your browser, the DNS system looks up the corresponding IP address so that your browser can connect to the correct server.
        
5. what is webpage?
    -> A webpage is a sample document which contains content (text, images, videos, etc.) that is displayed in a web browser.
    -> It can be viewed by the web browser and is typically written in HTML.
    -> It is identified by own unique URL.

6. what is website?
    -> A collection of web pages is known as a website. 
    -> a website is a collection of related web pages that are typically hosted on the same server and share a common domain name.
    -> For example, www.google.com is a website that contains multiple web pages (like the homepage, search results page, etc.) that are all part of the same site.

7. what is web application?
    -> A Web application is a software application that runs on a web server and is accessed through a web browser over the internet.
    -> Web application is a dynamic website that provides interactive features and functionality to users.
    -> Examples : online banking platforms, social media sites.

8. what is web browser?
    -> A web browser is a software application used to access and display information on the World Wide Web. 
    -> It acts as an interface that retrieves data from servers and translates code (like HTML) into the visual pages which we see and interact.

    =>Common examples include Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.

9. Static web page:
    -> content is fixed and does not change unless manually updated by the developer.
    -> typically created using HTML and CSS, and does not require server-side processing.

10. Dynamic web page:
    -> content can change based on user interactions, time, or other factors.
    => shopping websites, social media platforms and so on are examples of dynamic web pages.

11. URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
    -> url looks like: https://www.google.com/search?q=html+notes
    
    => https: - protocol
    => www - subdomain
    => google - domain name
    => .com - top-level domain (TLD) -> .com, .org, .net, etc.
    => /search - path
    => ?q=html+notes - query parameters

12. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):
    -> HTTP is the protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers.
    -> HTTP is an unsecured protocol, data is transmitted in plain text, which can be intercepted by attackers.
    -> Those links are scammy and can lead to security risks such as data breaches.
    
13. HTTPS (HTTP Secure):
    -> HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, which encrypts data transmitted between the browser and server using SSL/TLS protocols to protect against eavesdropping and tampering.

14. Ultimate goal of markup language:
    -> The ultimate goal of a markup language is to structure and format content in a way that can be easily interpreted and displayed by web browsers or other rendering engines. 
    -> Markup languages like HTML allow developers to define the structure, layout, and presentation of web content, making it accessible and visually appealing to users.


1. Normal text: This is a normal text.
2. Hypertext: This is a hyperlink text.


15. Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML):
    -> HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages and web applications.
    -> It provides the structure and content of a webpage such as text, images, links, and multimedia elements.

Evaluation of HTML:
    -> Initial version of HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 with 18 tags.
    -> Introduction of forms in HTML 2.0 (1995) allowed for user input and interactivity, which was a significant milestone in web development.
    -> HTML 3.2 (1997) introduced support for tables and improved styling capabilities.
    -> HTML 4.01 (1999) added support for multimedia elements and improved accessibility features.
    -> HTML5 (2014) is the latest version, which introduced new semantic elements,
    multimedia support, and enhanced APIs for web applications, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.
