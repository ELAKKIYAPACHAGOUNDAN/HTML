1. what is internet:
    -> abbreviation: inter-network communication
    -> internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols.(e.g., TCP/IP)
        -> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable data delivery and 
        -> IP (Internet Protocol) for addressing/routing packets. 

2. how does html page works?
    -> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages.
    -> From the browser page(client-side), a request is sent to server page(server side) via internet using standardized protocols(tcp/ip) and 
    the server side respond back to client side(browser) to display via internet. 
    
 3. Explain client-server architecture?   
    -> Client-Server Architecture:
        -> Client: The client is typically a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) that requests web pages and resources from a server.
        -> Server: The server is a computer that hosts websites and serves web pages to clients upon request.
        -> Communication: The client and server communicate over the internet using the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocols.   
        
4. diff between ip and dns?
    -> IP (Internet Protocol) Address:  
        IP address is the actual numerical "phone number" of a server (e.g., 142.250.190.46), 
    -> DNS (Domain Name System):
        DNS is the "phonebook" that translates human-friendly names (like google.com) into those numbers.        

    -> When you type a URL into your browser, the DNS system looks up the corresponding IP address so that your browser can connect to the correct server.

9. Static web page:
    -> content is fixed and does not change unless manually updated by the developer.
    -> typically created using HTML and CSS, and does not require server-side processing.
